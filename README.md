## Goal of the project :dart:

This repository contains the work done for the course of ***Design and Implementation of Mobile Applications*** at Politecnico di Milano.

UrbanHunt is a mobile application that lets users discover unusual and interesting places in their city, or a city they are visiting. When they are physically in one of the recommended places they can unlock it and get points to compete with other users. The places are crowdsourced, in fact users can add new places to the map.
